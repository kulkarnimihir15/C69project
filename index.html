            <p class="text-muted text-left">Greetings from Bloomington Junior High School! I would like to introduce our school to you and take some time to share what we are about. Folks often view middle school as the in-between phase. However, we know that it is much more than that, especially at BJHS. This time in a childâ€™s life is a very important one. It is critical to support students now, so they do not struggle later. That is why we focus just as much on social and emotional support as we do on academics. BJHS is a unique place because 1,200 students come together from six different elementary schools for the first time. In addition, we are a very diverse school. For some students, it is their first time interacting with kids who are different from them and they are exposed to the true culture and diversity of Bloomington. All the Owls, Wolves, Tigers, Super Stars, Sharks, and Mustangs are now Knights.</p>
